# About Roxy

* Roxy is a Slack bot built in Ruby and Sinatra. 

* She's hip, she's fun, and she's easily customizable! 

* For now, she will tell you information about git repositories if you ask

* In the future, Roxy will have built in responses and possibly a timer/calender functionality. 

* May add capabilities to email the current user of Roxy a copy of what was said to her and a summary of what she said for the day to help streamline the process.

* May add light machine learning to customize her responses even more.

* May be ported to Rails at some point if integration for ActionMailer and ActiveRecord is desired.

# Roxy's Future

* Currently, the only available action call will be 'issues' which will fetch the issues of a repo
### In the future, I will be adding:
* Forks
* Stars
* Latest Commit info
* Giving Roxy some personality
* Letting Roxy e-mail information about her chat interactions
* Scheduling messages/announcements
* In the future I will be creating a 'sibling/companion bot' for Roxy in Erlang/Elixir
* After said bot is written and released, add functionality for Roxy and said bot to interact with each other.
