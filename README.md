# About Roxy

* Roxy is a Slack bot built in Ruby and Sinatra. 

* She's hip, she's fun, and she's easily customizable! 

* For now, she will tell you information about git repositories if you ask

* In the future, Roxy will have built in responses and possibly a timer/calender functionality. 

* May add capabilities to email the current user of Roxy a copy of what was said to her and a summary of what she said for the day to help streamline the process.

* May add light machine learning to customize her responses even more.

* May be ported to Rails at some point if integration for ActionMailer and ActiveRecord is desired.
